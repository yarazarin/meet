Meet App
This repository contains the code for the Meet App, an awesome web application built with React using a fancy technique called test-driven development (TDD). It uses some cool Google Calendar stuff to fetch upcoming events.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to make a super cool web app that works without a server and can be used offline. It's all about providing a great user experience! We're using React and writing tests before coding (yeah, it's weird, but it works). Oh, and we're also adding some fancy graphs to make things look even better!

Key Features
Filter events by city (because who wants to see events from all over the world?)
Show/hide event details (sometimes you want more, sometimes less, we get it)
Choose the number of events you want to see (because too many events can be overwhelming)
Use the app even when you're offline (no internet, no problem!)
Add the app to your home screen (quick access, baby!)
Check out cool charts showing upcoming events and genres (let's visualize the data!)
User Stories
As a user, I want to filter events by city so I can see what's happening in a specific place.
As a user, I want to show/hide event details to get more or less info about an event.
As a user, I want to specify how many events I want to see at once because too much is too much.
As a user, I want to use the app offline and see the events I previously viewed (no internet, no worries).
As a user, I want to add the app to my home screen so I can access it quickly.
As a user, I want to see fancy charts showing upcoming events in different cities (visuals, baby!).
Technical Requirements
The app is built with React (the cool kid in town).
We're doing test-driven development (writing tests first, yeah, you read it right).
We're using Google Calendar API and OAuth2 for authentication (fancy stuff, huh?).
Instead of a traditional server, we're going serverless (AWS Lambda is the cool guy).
Our code is hosted on GitHub (because we're fancy developers).
The app works on all major browsers and even IE11 (we love compatibility).
It's responsive and looks good on all devices (from big screens to tiny ones).
We're following the PWA checklist (we want that "install" button to show up).
The app works offline (slow network? No problem, we got you covered).
You can install the app on your desktop and add it to your home screen on mobile (quick access, remember?).
We're deploying the app on GitHub Pages (let the world see it).
We have an alert system (because sometimes we need to show important info).
We're using data visualization (graphs, charts, cool stuff).
Our tests cover at least 90% of the code (we're testing ninjas).
We're monitoring the app's performance with a fancy online tool (performance matters, you know?).

Note: There are some mock-ups and advanced features in the complete README, but let's keep it simple for now.
